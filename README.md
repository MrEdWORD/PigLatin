# Pig Latin Converter
This is a pig latin converter tool that I created as a challenge from [Martyr2â€™s Mega Project List](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/). The challenge states: "Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: "banana" would yield anana-bay)." More information about Pig Latin and the rules can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin).

## Discussion
This was a simple learning exercise and I used it as an opportunity to practice test-driven-development. Of course, there are a number of other improvements that could have been included: converting Pig Latin back to english, allowing numbers and special characters, speech-to-text input, etc.
